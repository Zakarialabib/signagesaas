# Testing & Quality Assurance

This rule documents the standards and best practices for testing and quality assurance in the digital signage SaaS platform.

## Test Types & Directories

- [tests/Unit](mdc:tests/Unit): Unit tests for models, services, and business logic
- [tests/Feature](mdc:tests/Feature): Feature tests for HTTP endpoints, Livewire components, and workflows
- [tests/Feature/Livewire](mdc:tests/Feature/Livewire): Livewire component feature tests
- [tests/Feature/Auth](mdc:tests/Feature/Auth): Authentication and authorization tests
- [tests/Unit/Devices](mdc:tests/Unit/Devices): Device-specific unit tests
- [tests/Unit/Models](mdc:tests/Unit/Models): Model-specific unit tests

## Testing Standards

- All new features must include appropriate unit and feature tests
- Livewire components must have dedicated feature tests for all public actions and state changes
- Use Laravel Dusk for browser and Alpine.js interaction tests
- Accessibility (a11y) checks should be included for all major UI components
- Use factories and seeders for test data setup
- Use database transactions or refresh database trait for test isolation
- Mock external services and APIs

## Coverage & CI

- Maintain high code coverage for critical business logic
- All tests must pass in CI before merging
- Use PHPUnit for all automated tests
- Run Dusk tests for critical user flows

## Example Test Files

- [tests/Feature/Livewire/Devices/DeviceManagerTest.php](mdc:tests/Feature/Livewire/Devices/DeviceManagerTest.php)
- [tests/Unit/Devices/Services/DeviceServiceTest.php](mdc:tests/Unit/Devices/Services/DeviceServiceTest.php)

## Accessibility Checklist

- All interactive elements have keyboard focus
- Screen readers announce actions correctly
- Color contrast meets WCAG standards
