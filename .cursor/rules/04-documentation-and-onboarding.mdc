# Documentation & Onboarding

This rule documents the standards and best practices for project documentation and onboarding new contributors.

## Main Documentation

- [README.md](mdc:README.md): The primary entry point for project documentation
  - Overview of the project, architecture, and setup instructions
  - How to run the application locally (Docker, Composer, npm, etc.)
  - How to run tests and check code quality
  - Links to key Cursor rules for architecture, UI, and domain patterns

## Code Documentation

- All classes, methods, and properties should include PHPDoc blocks
- Use descriptive comments for complex logic and business rules
- Reference related Cursor rules in code comments where appropriate

## Onboarding Checklist

- Read the [README.md](mdc:README.md) for setup and architecture overview
- Review Cursor rules in `.cursor/rules` for standards and patterns
- Set up local environment using Docker and Composer
- Run the test suite to verify setup
- Review example Livewire components and tests

## Rule Referencing

- Reference files using `[filename.ext](mdc:filename.ext)` format in rules
- Update rules as new features or standards are introduced
